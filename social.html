                        <h2>Should social media be censored? Here’s what both sides have to say. </h2>
                        <p>In this video the topic of whether social media should or should not be censored was debated. A video showing
                            Mark Zuccerberg stating that social media platforms have two responsibilities when it comes to regulating
                            content. Removing dangerous content and upholding as wide a definition of freedom of expression. Points
                            such as where to draw the line on what posts should or shouldn’t be allowed were discussed. Two examples
                            given on types of posts that should be removed and types that should not be. A post that tells people to
                            vote on the wrong day should be removed but hate speech by a politician should not be removed as it allows it
                            to be seen. Facebook released a statement saying it should not be a company’s responsibility to fact check
                            political ads rather the people responsible for the post.

                        <h2>Real News vs. Fake News </h2>
                        <p>This video discusses the difference between Real and Fake news as well as their effects on society.
                            Fake news is defined in the video as news information which has been highly distorted with the i
                            ntention of manipulating viewers. This is considered dangerous because it allows people to dismiss
                            news they don’t like or disagree with due to politics. The video goes on to state that reporters must
                            verify all sources and avoid speculation when presenting news. Accurate news is important to a
                            society as it allows its citizens to make better choices.

                        <h3>Social Media: Misinformation and Content Moderation Issues for Congress. </h3>
                        <p>This article discusses members of the United States Congress growing concerns about the spread of
                            misinformation and exploring how it can be addressed by companies that operate social media sites.
                            The authors believe should congress address this issue they should consider the following things.
                            First, what the intended scope of their proposed actions. Second, under what conditions those actions
                            should be applied. Third, the range of potential legal, social, and economic consequences that may
                            be applied. Congress should also consider if actions taken imposes costs, monetary or otherwise,
                            and how that would affect the company in violation. The point was made about how such regulations
                            would fit in an internal legal framework.

                        <h3>Pew Research, the Future of Free Speech, Trolls, Anonymity, and Fake News Online. </h3>
                        <p>This article is a Pew Research study conducted on how fake news and freedom of speech continue to
                            trouble America’s society. The research suggests that many experts believe that manipulative behaviors
                            on the internet will continue to get worse. In recent years analysts have expressed increasing concerns
                            that the content, tone, and intent have undergone a change that threatens the internet as well as their
                            own future’s. A 2016 study showed that 64% of adults believe that fake news stories cause confusion about
                            basic facts. A large-scale study of technology experts by Pew Research and Elon University’s Imagining the
                            Internet center asked the following question “In the next decade, will public discourse online become more
                            or less shaped by bad actors, harassment, trolls, and an overall tone of griping distrust and disgust?”
                            42% said they believed we would see no major change, 39% more shaped by negative activities, and 19% less
                            shaped by negative activities. The following four major themes on the future of social climate were discussed.
                            The first, Things will stay the same because to troll is human, inequity will drive some inflammatory dialogue,
                            and the complexity of internet discourse makes this difficult to defeat. Second, Things will stay bad because
                            intangible and tangible economic or political incentives support trolling. Third, things will get better due
                            to the emergence of AI technologies. Fourth, oversight moderation will come at a cost. Some solutions could
                            further change the nature of the internet because surveillance will rise; states may regulate debate; and
                            changes will polarize people limiting access to information.
